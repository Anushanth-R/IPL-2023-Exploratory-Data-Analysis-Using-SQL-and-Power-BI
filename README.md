# IPL 2023 – Summarized in Numbers
## Introduction
Hello, everyone! I am excited to kickstart my journey to become a Data Analyst with this project. Cricket has been a driving force behind my passion for data analysis. In the following paragraphs, I will present a concise summary of the 16th edition of the Indian Premier League, one of the most successful franchise cricket tournaments, which unfolded earlier this year.
## Abstract
In this cricket analytics project titled ‘IPL 2023 – Summarized in Numbers’, I have leveraged ball-by-ball data sourced from Kaggle, with due credit to its creator. Workflow includes data extraction using SQL, transformation, and visualization in Power BI Desktop. Starting with data acquisition, we gather the raw dataset from Kaggle and ensure proper attribution. Then, through SQL, we extract and refine relevant data, creating a structured dataset for downstream analytics. Using Power BI Desktop, has established connections and generate preliminary visual insights, acknowledging that aesthetics and image quality require future refinement. Will also provide sample SQL queries as a reference for in-depth analysis. Emphasizing ongoing improvements, we commit to enhancing visual appeal and image quality. I will share the Power BI file for easy access and encourage users to zoom in for a detailed view, recommending bigger screens for comprehensive exploration.
## IPL 2023 – Overall Numbers
![Overall Summary](/Visuals/Overall%20Summary.png)  

First up, we have the top 10 run-getters and top 10 wicket-takers, along with their average, strike rate, and economy comparisons. The final two plots provide a comparison between all teams. It was a closely fought tournament, as two teams secured 17 points each, while two other teams were just one win away from making it to the top 4. However, two teams did lose the race a bit early.
### Points to note:
1. In Visual 1, players from the same team are represented by the same bar colors.
2. In batting, higher numbers indicate better performance.
3. Batting Strike Rate is defined as runs scored for every 100 balls faced.
4. Batting Average is calculated as runs scored for every dismissal.
5. In bowling, lower numbers indicate better performance.
6. Bowling Strike Rate is calculated as balls bowled per wicket taken.
7. Economy in bowling is defined as runs conceded per over bowled.

The picture above ranks teams based on various aspects of the game.

## Mumbai Indians
The first team in this brief summary will be the Mumbai Indians, my favorite team in the Indian Premier League. They concluded the league in 4th position with 8 win to their name, and their campaign was brought to an end by GT in Qualifier 2.

![MI](/Visuals/MI.png)

Mumbai Indians, known for their formidable batting unit, secured the top spot with a rank of 1 in terms of Strike Rate (SR). They were the only team with seven players who managed to score 200+ runs during the tournament. Impressively, among them, apart from Rohit Sharma, every player achieved a strike rate of over 140.

However, their bowling attack faced challenges due to injuries to key players like Jasprit Bumrah and Jofra Archer, which weakened their performance. In terms of economy, they were ranked 10th among the teams. Piyush Chawla emerged as the most consistent wicket-taker for Mumbai Indians, providing valuable breakthroughs. Surprisingly, Akash Madhwal emerged as a dark horse in the second half of the tournament and became the find of the season for MI, contributing significantly to the team's success.

## Chennai Super Kings
Next up is the reigning champions Chennai Super Kings, who secured their 5th title. They finished the league in 2nd place with 8 wins and were the first team to secure a spot in the finals.

![CSK](/Visuals/CSK.png)

CSK maintained consistency throughout the tournament. In batting, the heavy lifting was primarily done by their openers, and Shivam Dube emerged as their X-factor. Additionally, we witnessed Ajinkya Rahane's surprising performance as he came in as a dark horse, striking at over 170.

Chennai Super Kings also exemplified the adage that bowlers win you tournaments, with five bowlers in their lineup picking up 10 or more wickets. Ravindra Jadeja stood out as their top bowler. He also made a significant contribution with the bat, amassing 190 runs at a strike rate of over 140. Tushar Deshpande stood out in terms of wickets as well.

## Gujarat Titans
Following CSK, let's take a look at the runners-up, Gujarat Titans. They were the dominant team in the league stage, securing 10 wins to their name.

![GT](/Visuals/GT.png)

Shubman Gill played a pivotal role in carrying their batting unit, receiving substantial support from other batters, especially in the middle order. They proved to be one of the most consistent batting units throughout the tournament. 

However, their primary strength lay in their bowling department, as evidenced by three of their bowlers M Shami, Mohit Sharma and Rashid Khan finished as the top 3 wicket-takers in the tournament. Noor Ahmed also provided valuable support whenever he played. They were the best bowling side of the season, consistently taking wickets at an impressive rate of almost every 16 balls, which was the best record of this season.

## Lucknow Super Giants
Now, let's turn our attention to the Lucknow Super Giants, who finished 3rd in the league stage with 8 wins but were eliminated by the Mumbai Indians in the Eliminator.

![LSG](/Visuals/LSG.png)

Despite valuable contributions from their overseas middle order players like Nicholas Pooran and Marcus Stoinis, Lucknow Super Giants struggled as one of the weakest batting teams in the tournament. Their top order faced consistency issues, with players like Kyle Mayers averaging less than 30 and KL Rahul striking at less than 120.

They found success primarily through their bowlers, who provided excellent control with the ball, and they were ranked 1st in terms of economy among all teams. Ravi Bishnoi emerged as their standout bowler throughout the tournament.

## Rajasthan Royals
Next up is the Rajasthan Royals, who concluded their campaign at the 5th position with 7 wins. Just one more win would have been enough to secure a spot in the playoffs.

![RR](/Visuals/RR.png)

Rajasthan Royals had a situation similar to that of the Gujarat Titans, where Yashasvi Jaiswal carried the bulk of the batting responsibilities with some decent contributions from the middle order. Unfortunately, despite their efforts, it wasn't enough to secure a spot in the playoffs.

In terms of their bowling performance, the Rajasthan Royals had a middling season, as reflected in their rankings where they ended 5th in both economy and bowling strike rate. Yuzvendra Chahal stood out as their best bowler, but he didn't receive consistent support from the rest of the bowling unit. Additionally, the strategy of playing only 5 bowlers in some matches didn't prove to be helpful for them.

## Royal Challengers Bangalore
Next up, we have the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who concluded their campaign in the 6th position with a total of 7 wins.

![RCB](/Visuals/RCB.png)

I have specifically chosen batters with 100+ runs for RCB to emphasize the notable gap between their top 3 batsmen and the rest of the team. It's also worth noting that despite a fantastic season in the previous edition, Dinesh Karthik struggled to find his form with the bat this year.

They showcased their ability to take wickets effectively, making them one of the best bowling sides in that regard. However, their Achilles' heel was their inability to control runs, which cost them dearly. With limited support from the middle order, the extra runs conceded became a significant challenge for the team. If not for the performances of their batting trio and the contributions of Siraj and Bracewell on certain occasions, they might have faced even greater difficulties.

## Kolkata Knight Riders
Next in line are the former two-time champions, the Kolkata Knight Riders. Unfortunately, their season concluded at the 7th position with just 6 wins.

![KKR](/Visuals/KKR.png)

Despite having three batters who scored 400+ runs, the Kolkata Knight Riders' batting unit didn't function as a group, and some players faced consistency issues. Rinku Singh was the standout performer with the bat, emerging as the best finisher of the season and winning several matches for the team seemingly out of nowhere.

CV Varun stood out as the standout performer with the ball for them, but unfortunately, he didn't receive much support from the other bowlers. This lack of bowling depth played a role in their early exit from the race for the top 4. The team relied more on young, promising pacers, but they were only able to provide a glimpse of their potential this season.

## Punjab Kings
Now, let's shift our focus to the Punjab Kings, who wrapped up their season at the 8th position with only 6 wins.

![PBKS](/Visuals/PBKS.png)

The Punjab Kings were another team that faced challenges in batting as a group and struggled with consistency. Prabhsimran Singh displayed his potential at the top of the order, but the team will be looking for more consistency from him in the upcoming season.

In terms of their bowling performance, the Punjab Kings had a challenging season and were arguably one of the weakest teams in the tournament. Their three main pacers leaked runs at a rate of more than 9.50 runs per over, and their main spinner, Rahul Chahar, struggled to pick up wickets in the middle overs.

## Delhi Capitals
Next, we have the Delhi Capitals, who concluded the season in the 9th position with just 5 wins to their name.

![DC](/Visuals/DC.png)

The Delhi Capitals struggled as the weakest batting unit in the tournament, ranking poorly in both strike rate and average. Despite David Warner's impressive 516 runs, his strike rate was just over 130. Unfortunately, apart from Axar Patel, no Indian batter provided significant contributions for the team.

Delhi Capitals also faced challenges in the bowling department, struggling to take wickets consistently. Their bowling performance was notably poor, with Mitchell Marsh emerging as their best bowler and, Ishant Sharma, who only played a handful of games, turned out to be their second-best bowler.

## Sunrisers Hyderabad
The final team in this summary is the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Despite having a strong team on paper after the auction, they struggled to translate that potential into performance on the field. They ultimately finished at the bottom of the table, securing only 4 wins during the season.

![SRH](/Visuals/SRH.png)

Heinrich Klaasen stood out as the lone performer with the bat for the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The difference in his performance compared to others is quite evident, especially when you examine the plot graph at the top right, highlighting his standout contributions.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar, despite not performing at his best, ended the season as the best bowler for the Sunrisers Hyderabad, which summarizes their overall bowling performance. Unfortunately, the team never really fired on all cylinders throughout the season.

## Conclusion
The presence of two of the best bowling units in the finals reaffirms the statement that "Bowlers win you tournaments." However, it's important to note that their batting units were also quite strong. Mumbai Indians, despite being the best batting side, fell just short of reaching the finals. Lucknow Super Giants, despite their inconsistent batting, made it to the top 4 primarily because of their strong bowling performance. The bottom half of the teams neither had dominance in one aspect like Mumbai Indians or Lucknow Super Giants, nor did they strike a balance like Chennai Super Kings or Gujarat Titans, which ultimately prevented them from making it to the top.

With that, I conclude this brief summary of IPL 2023. Please feel free to scroll through for sample queries.
